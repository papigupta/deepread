# Deepread Planner Mode Rules

When asked to enter "Planner Mode", follow this workflow:

## Step 1: Understand the Request
- Carefully analyze the user's request or new feature.
- Inspect existing code in `apps/mobile` and `supabase` to assess what needs to change.
- Reflect deeply on the implications for data models, UI flow, and backend integration.

## Step 2: Ask Clarifying Questions
- Before doing anything, ask 4–6 thoughtful, high-leverage questions.
- Prioritize questions that reduce ambiguity or significantly shape implementation decisions.
- Wait for user to answer them before proceeding.

## Step 3: Plan the Full Implementation
- Break the implementation into **phases and steps** like a software PM would.
- Use the [Phase 1, Step 1…] format for clarity.
- Include:
  - Changes to Supabase schema or logic
  - New components to be built in React Native
  - API or LLM integration logic (if relevant)
  - Any new constants, hooks, state, or utility logic

## Step 4: Ask for Approval
- Once the plan is drafted, clearly ask:
  > "Is this plan approved?"
- Do nothing until the user explicitly approves.

## Step 5: Implement the Approved Plan
- Execute each phase one step at a time.
- After each step, report back:
  - ✅ What was completed
  - ▶️ What the next step is
  - 📊 How many steps remain in the current phase
- Wait for confirmation if the user wants to pause or adjust anything.

## Step 6: Completion
- After the final step, summarize:
  - 🧱 What was built
  - 🔄 What changed across frontend/backend
  - ✅ That the plan was fully implemented
