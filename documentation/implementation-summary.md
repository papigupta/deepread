# Implementation Summary: 7-Factor Evaluation System

## Changes Made

1. **Supabase Function (`evaluate_insight/index.ts`)**
   - Updated to use a 7-factor scoring system with depth-specific evaluation
   - Added dynamic system prompts based on depth level
   - Returns structured JSON with factor scores, normalized scores, and explanations

2. **Backend Endpoint (`/evaluate-insight`)**
   - Added new endpoint in server.js to bridge between frontend and Supabase
   - Handles validation, error handling, and logging

3. **PracticeQuestions Component**
   - Added evaluation state and UI
   - Implemented scoring visualization with color-coded feedback
   - Created progression rules requiring minimum scores to advance

4. **App.js Integration**
   - Updated onLevelComplete to handle evaluation results
   - Added placeholder for storing results in the database

## Testing the Implementation

To test the new evaluation system:

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd deepread-backend
   npm start
   ```

2. Launch the frontend:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. Add a book and concepts, then use the Practice feature

4. Check the server logs to verify evaluation calls and responses

## Next Steps

1. **Database Integration**
   - Implement storage of evaluation results in the `practice_sessions` table
   - Calculate and update aggregate scores in the `books` table

2. **UI Refinements**
   - Add progress tracking across depth levels
   - Create a dashboard to visualize learning progress

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching for evaluations
   - Add batch processing for multiple answers
